    <p>They came from the sky with the unusually harsh winter of 2084 to greet them, Obscurred like spirits as they slipped across the bitter veil above. Their mishapen fleet glided lifelessly beneath a decidedly unfitting placid sky.  </p>
      
<p>Hours passed with no commmunication returned as the ships tore at the air above in eerie silence. Below, the capital became a terrifying arena embroiled in a now laughable battle between the makeshift schools of thought. Others watched in fear and wonder, anticipating a change that was to shape generations long after their own. </p>
      
      <p>Later, only 2 facts were established, any other claims being lost to antiquity.</p>
      
      <p>The former was that humanity caused more damage to itself than the alien visitors ever did; their fleet passing as quickly as it came yet dividing the planet under a seemingly unresolvable tension.</p>
      
      <p>The latter was concluded much later as humanity discovered its own unique position; a glistening throne of intergalactic trade and, more importantly, politics. Originally, Earth was observed with intrigue as the ‘late comer’ to long-distance space travel and interstellar technology; yet had a capability for logic and reason unrivalled by any colour of distant lifeform to grace the stars. Quickly noticed by the limitless galaxies’ denizens, Earth swapped its political prowess for the best technology leading to a veritable golden age. Over decades of astounding growth Earth reformed the galaxy in their image, shaping it to true human vanity and mounting above its empires.</p>
